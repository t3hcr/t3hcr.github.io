Coming back to whittle on this little side project to get a small blog setup for myself.

Today, read through commenting options for Github pages/blogs.  I'm leaning towards open source situations - and desiring to keep content (including comments) as close to my virtual home as possible.  

The key source of help was this blog article by François-Xavier Cat: https://lazywinadmin.com/2019/04/moving_blog_comments.html (thanks François!)

Utterances (https://utteranc.es) will allow for me to keep comments within the blog itself. (Saved as GitHub issues on the blog repo)

A bit more info can be seen at Utterance's site at: https://utteranc.es/?installation_id=1271653&setup_action=install

Have fun out there!
