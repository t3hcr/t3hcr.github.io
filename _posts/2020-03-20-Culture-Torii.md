This is something new I learned about recently.  While reading some blog posts, I noticed a SaaS product called Torii.

Being a good netizen, I did a quick websearch for Torii to see if I could dig a bit more into it.  Turns out, I got side tracked for a bit of culture. (one of my favorite kinds of distractions!) And now, I'm sharing this with you.

Torii, the traditional gateway : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii>

You've likely seen a real torii before if you've viewed photos from Asia -- especially Japan, if I understand correctly.  I never knew that's what those structures were named, nor their purpose.

Now I know, and so do you. üòÅ
