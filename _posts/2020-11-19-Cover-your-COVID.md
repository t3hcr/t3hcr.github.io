I remember years ago signs saying, "cover your cough" posted all over the workplace.

Then, came the "wash your hands" campaigns.

Now, "wear your mask" is the mandate.

Don't get me wrong -- I'm all for public initiatives to help us all move forward in health.

I'm just really struggling with people in my life who think they won't get sick.  

I'm struggling with my "loyalty" complex toward people I am subordinate to who believe that.  

I'm struggling to balance the health of my loved ones with the wreckless abandon of those I work near.

I'm tired of trying and tired of struggling with the sinful nature that doesn't listen to wisdom and listening to those who have spent their lives educating themselves to save lives.  

<i>Lord, save us.</i>
